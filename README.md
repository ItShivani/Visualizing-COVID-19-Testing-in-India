Rate of Covid Positive for Testing in different States of India
This chloropleth map illustrates the number of positive outcomes of all the tests conducted in each state. 
We can conclude that Maharashtra, Telangana,Tamil Nadu,Gujarat,Madhya Pradesh have a high Covid positive rate from testing. This implies that they have a high number of positive patients and should focus on testing more. 
This mapping should be done district wise as well so testing can be effectively increased in certain areas. 

Drawbacks: 
Union Territories and Jammu and Kashmir are not represented well.
